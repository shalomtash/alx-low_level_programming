Positive anything is better than negative nothing
This program will assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print whether the number stored in the variable n is positive or negative.

You can find the source code here
The variable n will store a different value every time you will run this program
The output of the program should be:
The number, followed by
if the number is greater than 0: is positive
if the number is 0: is zero
if the number is less than 0: is negative
followed by a new line

The last digit
This program will assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print the last digit of the number stored in the variable n.

You can find the source code here
The variable n will store a different value every time you run this program
The output of the program should be:
The string Last digit of, followed by
n, followed by
the string is, followed by
if the last digit of n is greater than 5: the string and is greater than 5
