      Bit manipulation

Project done during Full Stack Software Engineering studies at Alx School. It aims to learn about how to manipulate bits and use bitwise operators in C language.

0. 0
0-binary_to_uint.c	Converts a binary number to an unsigned int.

1. 1
1-print_binary.c	Prints the binary representation of a number.

2. 10
2-get_bit.c	Returns the value of a bit at a given index.

3. 11
3-set_bit.c	Sets the value of a bit to 1 at a given index.

4. 100
4-clear_bit.c	Sets the value of a bit to 0 at a given index.

5. 101
5-flip_bits.c	Returns the number of bits needed to flip to get from one number to another.

6. Endianness
100-get_endianess.c	Checks the endianness.

7. Crackme3
101-password	Script that contains the password of crackme3 file.
